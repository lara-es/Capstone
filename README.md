# Capstone

Introduction: Every report needs a strong introduction. This is where you intro the reader to the project, the reasons for carrying out the analysis & what you expect to achieve by doing so. This should also be where you lay out the table of contents.
Methodology: This does not need to be technical. Simply describe the data you are using and the types of analyses you have conducted & why.
Results: This is the main body of the report, and likely split into sections according to the various business questions the report attempts to answer & the results generated for each question.
Decision Recommendations: Ok, so you have completed the project, run the analyses & generated your results. What are the recommended business actions based on these insights? Be objective.
Conclusion: Tie the entire report up (in a single paragraph if possible), from the starting objective of the project to the recommended decision outcomes. In this final section you can add your own personal touch â€” what the results mean from your perspective & perhaps your recommendations for future analyses on the subject.
